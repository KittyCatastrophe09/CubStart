<h1 align="center">Hullo ðŸ’¬</h1>

Do you miss AOL? Me neither. But I do miss the _aesthetic_ of AOL. There was a strange romanticism to entering a room with someone and having a conversation. Relay chats inspire the same kind of voyeurism. [Hullo](https://hullo.amks.me) is an open chatroom exposed to everyone in the internet. At any point, anyone can drop in, have a chat, and leave. 

Hullo has no backend. It does not save any of your messages. Instead, it uses websockets to connect various computers to each other and broadcast messages. When you log out of a session, the messages you sent are lost forever to you. Hullo is built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/) and [socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io), and hosted on [Heroku](https://twitter.com/heroku?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).
