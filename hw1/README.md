1. I linked my Github and LinkedIn to the buttons 
2. I used span (because I was having syntax trouble with it) 
to describe this project in my project 1 section, adding rainbows to the text
3. I linked the Project 1 github link to the hw1 folder in my github
and the assignment on the course website I also created a short bio for Project 
2 and linked it to the instructions.
4. I added a link to my resume pdf that I have added to the hw1 folder.
5. I also added pictures of my cats.
