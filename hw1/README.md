1. I linked my Github and LinkedIn to the buttons (I don't have a public resume yet)
2. I used span (because I was having syntax trouble with it) 
to describe this project in my project 1 section, adding rainbows to the text
3. I linked the Project 1 github link to the hw1 folder in my github
and the assignment on the course website
